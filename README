Pythm 0.4 Readme

to try pythm out, start the "pythm" script in the base directory.

Requirements:
- pygtk
- mplayer to use the mplayer backend
- a server running mpd to use mpd backend

The default is to use the mplayer backend.

If you want to try the mpd backend, place the pythm.conf-example (from the data directory)
in ~/.pythm/ and rename it to pythm.conf.
then edit the file and set mpd host/port/passwort there.


Common Problems:
- Bug in pygtk on the FreeRunner: http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1718
- Bad GUI performance with mplayer backend.
