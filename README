Pythm 0.4 Readme

Description:
------------
	Pythm is a media player gui designed to work with mplayer or mpd as "slave" players.
	use mplayer to hear music on the road or mpd control if your are at home.

Installing pythm:
-----------------
	install pythm using opkg install <pkg>. Start with the shortcut or use 
	the terminal and type "pythm-bin"
	
Run pythm with the source package:
----------------------------------
	Extract the source tarball, change to the Pythm-0.4 directory and start pythm
	using the executable script "./pythm-bin" 

Requirements:
-------------
	- pygtk
	- mplayer to use the mplayer backend
	- a server running mpd to use mpd backend


Using mpd / config file:
------------------------
	Place the pythm.conf-example (from the conf directory)
	in ~/.pythm/ and rename it to pythm.conf.
	Change the settings in the file to fit your needs.


Common Problems:
----------------
	- bug in pygtk on the FreeRunner: http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1718
	- bad GUI performance with mplayer backend.
	- i18n: gettext support not implemented, planning
	- mplayer-backend: random mode not implemented
